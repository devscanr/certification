# DevScanr certification platform

This project aims to help developers to present their open source contributions (projects, experiments, stars – all public activity in general)
in a way that is readable and clear to tech recruiters. Namely, all work is aggregated and presented as a certificate.

## About DevScanr Certificate

**A certificate from DevScanr confirms the authenticity of a specialization and seniority** of its respective holder. 
It acknowledges that these key statements, declared in a resume or on a GitHub profile page are correct.

The validation process involves a deep analysis of a GitHub profile: repositories, contributions,
activities, social metrics, ratings, etc. using by dedicated machine learning algorithms.
Additionally, each certificate is manually approved by a subject matter expert from our team.

This document establishes a strong foundation of trust to engineers’ skills for the following reasons:

- It is based on time-stamped data that can’t be altered afterwards (while preserving the same timestamps).
- It is based on real-world user activity that was never intended to present someone in the best light.
- It relies on unbiased fourth party confirmations (earned stars, followers, etc.).
- DevScanr adds an ad-hoc layer of data checks to reduce the chances of fabrication to almost zero.

For a resume with no certificate we have to solely rely on the objectivity and credibility of its creator.
A testimonial from a former colleague can increase our trust to a certain extent.
But only a document issued by a neutral third party can be fully trustworthy.
DevScanr certificates go beyond that, being based on a career-agnostic information and unforgeable
community signals. We can’t guarantee that a certificate holder is a “good person” though.

### Certificate Structure

- Typical fields such as title, personal details, certificate ID, issue date
- Verified competences
- Top tech skills dynamic
- Top tech skills in comparison
    
### Limitations

Our analysis is exclusively based on public repositories, contributions, and interactions.
“Above average” open-source activity does not necessarily mean that someone is a better engineer.
Though, to be fair, we think that any objective proof of someone’s capabilities is better than
just barebone claims in a resume text.

We are naturally limited by the quality of our data and algorithms. There’re many of them
and a lot of math is involved. Not all skills can be properly recognized, no competency
can be perfectly quantified – we totally acknowledge that and apologize for all potential
mistakes and imperfections. We continuously improve the quality of the product and,
hopefully, the things will become more precise and refined over time.
