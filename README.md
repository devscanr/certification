# DevScanr certification platform

This project helps developers to present their open source work and achievements in a form 
that is readable to tech recruiters. Namely, in the form of a certificate.

### Motivation

Our data on LinkedIn or in a personal resume is not fully reliable. Many job seekers falsify
their experiences and titles to apply for better positions. Recruiters are aware of the problem
and, every year, they pay more attention to the evidentiary part of the resume.
Which includes: skill upvotes from your friends (to a minimal extent), testimonials, certificates.

Certificate is the strongest evidence of a qualification since it is issued by a neutral party.
Developers invest time and money in getting them, knowing that it will help
them to find a higher paying job and/or find it faster. DevScanr certificates are free, but can
be obtained only by developers who cared to sustain and evolve their public profiles over the years.

## About DevScanr Certificate

**A certificate from DevScanr confirms the authenticity of a specialization and seniority** of its respective holder. 
It acknowledges that these key statements, declared in a resume or on a GitHub profile page are correct.

The validation process involves an automatic analysis of a GitHub profile: repositories, contributions,
activities, social metrics, ratings, etc. by dedicated ML algorithms.
Additionally, each certificate is manually approved by a subject matter expert from our team.

This document establishes a strong foundation of trust to engineers’ skills for the following reasons:

- It is based on time-stamped data that can’t be altered afterwards (while preserving the same timestamps).
- It is based on real-world user activity that was never intended to present someone in the best light.
- It relies on unbiased fourth party confirmations (earned stars, followers, etc.).
- DevScanr adds an ad-hoc layer of data checks to reduce the chances of fabrication to almost zero.

### Certificate Structure

Each document is individual and contains insights about a unique experience and
competences, history of tech applications, interests, etc. 

- Typical fields such as title, personal details, certificate ID, issue date
- Verified competences
- Top tech skills dynamic
- Top tech skills in comparison
    
### Limitations

Our analysis is exclusively based on public repositories, contributions, and interactions.
“Above average” open-source activity does not necessarily mean that someone is a better engineer.
Though, to be fair, we think that any objective proof of someone’s capabilities is better than
just barebone claims in a resume text.

We are naturally limited by the quality of our data and algorithms. There’re many of them
and a lot of math is involved. Not all skills can be properly recognized, no competency
can be perfectly quantified – we totally acknowledge that and apologize for all potential
mistakes and imperfections. We continuously improve the quality of the product and,
hopefully, the things will become more precise and refined over time.
